# Translate and speak

Translate and speak allows people to use a text-to-speech translator speak for them.

## Installation



```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need a virtual audio cable installed. This example uses the one found from https://vb-audio.com/Cable/

## Usage

Run this program and type whatever you want translated to English into the console window. It will then translate it and speak it out loud which could be used as a microphone input on any application.

You can enable playback in Windows sound settings to be able to hear yourself and confirm that it is working.
